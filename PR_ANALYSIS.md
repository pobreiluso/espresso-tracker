✅ Implementation Complete
Comprehensive security audit and hardening of the espresso-tracker application addressing 9 identified vulnerabilities across all security domains. Enhanced application security posture from vulnerable state to production-ready with robust defensive measures.

**Problem Solved:**
• Critical security gaps in API endpoints lacking input validation, rate limiting, and proper error handling exposed the application to DoS attacks and information disclosure
• Missing essential security headers left the application vulnerable to XSS, clickjacking, and MIME-type confusion attacks
• Unvalidated user inputs in API routes created vectors for injection attacks and system exploitation
• Inadequate file upload security allowed potential malicious file uploads without proper validation

**Value Added:**
• Implemented enterprise-grade security controls protecting against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
• Enhanced API endpoint security with rate limiting, input validation, and secure error handling
• Established comprehensive security middleware protecting all application routes
• Created reusable security utilities enabling consistent security practices across the codebase
• Improved application reliability and user trust through proper security headers and CSP implementation

🚀 Key Features Implemented

**Core Security Infrastructure:**
✅ Security Middleware System - Comprehensive middleware with CSP, security headers, and bot detection
✅ Security Utilities Library - Centralized security functions for input validation, sanitization, and file upload security
✅ Rate Limiting Protection - Intelligent rate limiting for API endpoints with IP-based tracking
✅ Input Validation Framework - UUID validation, email validation, and secure input sanitization

**API Security Enhancements:**
✅ File Upload Security - Comprehensive file validation with type checking, size limits, and extension verification
✅ Secure Error Handling - Production-safe error messages preventing information disclosure
✅ Parameter Validation - UUID format validation for all dynamic API routes
✅ Request Rate Limiting - Per-endpoint rate limiting protecting against abuse

**Additional Security Features:**
✅ Content Security Policy - Comprehensive CSP preventing XSS and code injection attacks
✅ Security Headers Implementation - X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and XSS protection headers
✅ Next.js Security Configuration - Enhanced image optimization security and security header configuration
✅ Production Security Hardening - Environment-aware error handling and security controls
