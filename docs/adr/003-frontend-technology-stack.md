# ADR-003: Frontend Technology Stack

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-09-10

## Context
We need to build a modern, responsive web application for coffee tracking that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. The application requires:

- Server-side rendering for SEO and performance
- Real-time capabilities for live updates
- Image upload and processing
- Complex form handling with multi-step workflows
- Professional UI/UX suitable for coffee enthusiasts
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for mobile usage

## Decision
We will use the following frontend technology stack:

### Core Framework
- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **React 18** with modern hooks and concurrent features
- **TypeScript** with strict mode for type safety

### Styling and UI
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Catppuccin Macchiato** color scheme for aesthetic appeal
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography
- **Custom CSS-in-JS** for component-specific styles

### State Management
- **React Hooks** (useState, useEffect, useContext) for local state
- **Supabase Real-time** for server state synchronization
- **Custom hooks** for business logic abstraction

### Development Tools
- **ESLint** with Next.js configuration
- **TypeScript** strict mode
- **Hot reload** for development efficiency

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Modern DX**: Excellent developer experience with hot reload and TypeScript
- **Performance**: Server-side rendering and automatic optimizations
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design works well on all devices
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents runtime errors and improves maintainability
- **SEO Friendly**: Server-side rendering improves search engine optimization
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of React components and Next.js plugins

### Negative
- **Complexity**: App Router introduces some learning curve
- **Bundle Size**: React and Next.js add significant JavaScript payload
- **Build Time**: TypeScript compilation adds to build time
- **Framework Lock-in**: Tightly coupled to Next.js ecosystem

### Trade-offs
- **Performance vs Developer Experience**: Chose DX optimization over minimal bundle size
- **Type Safety vs Development Speed**: Strict TypeScript slows initial development but improves long-term maintainability
- **Framework Features vs Simplicity**: Next.js features justify added complexity

## Implementation Details

### Project Structure
```
src/
├── app/              # Next.js App Router
│   ├── (pages)/      # Route groups
│   ├── api/          # API routes
│   └── globals.css   # Global styles
├── components/       # React components
│   ├── ui/           # Reusable UI components
│   └── layouts/      # Layout components
├── lib/              # Utility functions
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
└── types/            # TypeScript definitions
```

### Component Architecture
- **Compound Components**: For complex UI patterns
- **Custom Hooks**: For business logic separation
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: For prop type safety
- **Error Boundaries**: For graceful error handling

### Styling Approach
```typescript
// Tailwind utility classes for consistent styling
const buttonStyles = "px-4 py-2 bg-peach text-base rounded-xl hover:bg-peach/90 transition-colors"

// Component-specific overrides when needed
const customStyles = {
  backgroundImage: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #f093fb 0%, #f5576c 100%)'
}
```

### State Management Pattern
```typescript
// Local component state
const [brews, setBrews] = useState<Brew[]>([])

// Custom hooks for business logic
const { settings, updateSettings } = useSettings()

// Supabase real-time subscriptions
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = supabase
    .channel('brews')
    .on('postgres_changes', 
        { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'brews' },
        handleBrewChange)
    .subscribe()
    
  return () => subscription.unsubscribe()
}, [])
```

### TypeScript Configuration
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true
  }
}
```

## Mobile Optimization

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Service worker for offline capabilities
- Web app manifest for installation
- Responsive images and lazy loading

### Touch-Friendly UI
- Large touch targets (minimum 44px)
- Swipe gestures for navigation
- Camera integration for photo capture

### Performance Optimizations
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Prefetching for improved navigation

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Vite + React**: Faster build times but less full-stack integration
2. **SvelteKit**: Smaller bundle size but smaller ecosystem
3. **Astro**: Great for static sites but less suitable for dynamic features
4. **Vue.js + Nuxt**: Good framework but team more familiar with React
5. **Remix**: Interesting approach but newer ecosystem

## Development Workflow

### Component Development
- Start with TypeScript interfaces
- Build components in isolation
- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Test across different screen sizes

### Styling Workflow
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Use Tailwind utilities first
- Custom CSS only when necessary
- Consistent spacing and color schemes

### Code Quality
- ESLint for code consistency
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- Component composition over inheritance
- Custom hooks for logic reuse

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Optimization
- Tree shaking for unused code elimination
- Dynamic imports for route-level code splitting
- Image optimization with WebP format
- Font optimization with next/font

### Runtime Performance
- React.memo for expensive components
- useMemo and useCallback for expensive computations
- Virtualization for large lists
- Optimistic updates for better perceived performance

## Notes
This technology stack provides a solid foundation for building a modern coffee tracking application. The combination of Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS offers excellent developer experience while delivering a performant, accessible user interface suitable for coffee enthusiasts on both desktop and mobile devices.
