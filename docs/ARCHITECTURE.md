# Architecture Decision Records

This document outlines key architectural decisions made in the Espresso Tracker application.

## ADR-001: Next.js App Router Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-10  
**Context:** Need to choose a React framework and routing approach for a modern coffee tracking application.

**Decision:** Use Next.js 15 with App Router for the application architecture.

**Rationale:**
- **Server Components**: Better performance through server-side rendering of components
- **File-based Routing**: Intuitive organization of pages and API routes
- **Built-in Optimization**: Automatic image optimization, code splitting, and performance features
- **API Routes**: Serverless functions for backend logic without separate server setup
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript integration for type safety

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Excellent developer experience with hot reload and built-in optimizations
- ✅ SEO-friendly server-side rendering for better discoverability
- ✅ Simplified deployment to Vercel with zero configuration
- ❌ Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with App Router patterns

## ADR-002: Supabase Backend-as-a-Service

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-10  
**Context:** Need a scalable, reliable backend solution for user authentication, data storage, and file management.

**Decision:** Use Supabase as the primary backend service.

**Rationale:**
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Full-featured relational database with JSONB support
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level security for multi-tenant applications
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Live updates for collaborative features
- **Built-in Authentication**: Multiple auth providers with secure session management
- **File Storage**: Integrated storage solution for coffee photos and uploads
- **Local Development**: Docker-based local development environment

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Rapid development with pre-built authentication and database features
- ✅ Strong consistency and ACID transactions from PostgreSQL
- ✅ Automatic API generation from database schema
- ❌ Vendor lock-in with Supabase-specific features

## ADR-003: OpenAI Vision API for Coffee Analysis

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-10  
**Context:** Need AI-powered analysis of coffee photos for extraction quality assessment and bag information extraction.

**Decision:** Integrate OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API with expert coffee consultant prompts.

**Rationale:**
- **Vision Capabilities**: Advanced image understanding for coffee-specific analysis
- **Contextual Analysis**: Ability to provide scientific reasoning and recommendations
- **Flexible Prompting**: Custom expert personas for specialized coffee knowledge
- **JSON Response Format**: Structured data output for consistent application integration
- **Fallback Strategy**: Mock data system for development and API failures

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Professional-grade coffee analysis equivalent to expert consultation
- ✅ Detailed, actionable recommendations for brewing improvement
- ✅ Automated bag information extraction saving manual data entry
- ❌ External API dependency with potential rate limits and costs
- ❌ Requires careful prompt engineering for consistent results

## ADR-004: TypeScript Strict Mode

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-10  
**Context:** Need to ensure code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity in a TypeScript codebase.

**Decision:** Enable TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type definitions.

**Rationale:**
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete, refactoring, and navigation
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Types serve as inline documentation
- **Maintainability**: Easier to refactor and modify code with confidence
- **API Contracts**: Clear interfaces between components and services

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Reduced runtime errors and improved code reliability
- ✅ Enhanced developer experience with better tooling support
- ✅ Easier onboarding for new developers with clear type contracts
- ❌ Initial setup overhead for comprehensive type definitions
- ❌ Potential learning curve for developers new to TypeScript

## ADR-005: Tailwind CSS for Styling

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-10  
**Context:** Need a maintainable, consistent styling solution that supports responsive design and theming.

**Decision:** Use Tailwind CSS with custom color palette (Catppuccin Macchiato theme).

**Rationale:**
- **Utility-First Approach**: Rapid development with pre-defined utility classes
- **Responsive Design**: Built-in breakpoint system for mobile-first development
- **Custom Theming**: Easy customization with CSS custom properties
- **Performance**: Purged CSS output for minimal production bundle size
- **Component Consistency**: Shared design tokens across all components

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Consistent design system with minimal CSS maintenance
- ✅ Excellent mobile responsiveness with utility classes
- ✅ Dark mode support through custom color palette
- ❌ HTML can become verbose with many utility classes
- ❌ Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with utility-first CSS

## ADR-006: Component-Based Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-10  
**Context:** Need to organize UI components for reusability, maintainability, and testing.

**Decision:** Implement a hierarchical component structure with separation between UI and business logic.

**Structure:**
```
src/components/
├── ui/           # Reusable UI components (Button, Input, etc.)
├── auth/         # Authentication-specific components
├── [feature]/    # Feature-specific components (BagCard, BrewAnalysis, etc.)
└── Layout.tsx    # Application layout wrapper
```

**Rationale:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI components separate from business logic
- **Reusability**: Shared UI components across different features
- **Testability**: Isolated components easier to test
- **Maintainability**: Clear organization makes code easier to find and modify
- **TypeScript Integration**: Strong typing for component props and interfaces

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Consistent UI patterns across the application
- ✅ Easier testing and debugging of individual components
- ✅ Better code organization and developer productivity
- ❌ Initial overhead in setting up component hierarchies
- ❌ Potential over-abstraction if taken too far

## ADR-007: Mock Data Strategy

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-10  
**Context:** Need to support development and testing without external API dependencies or API key requirements.

**Decision:** Implement comprehensive mock data system for AI analysis and bag extraction.

**Rationale:**
- **Development Speed**: No need for OpenAI API keys during development
- **Reliability**: Consistent behavior during development and testing
- **Cost Control**: Avoid API costs during development iterations
- **Offline Development**: Work without internet connectivity
- **Testing**: Predictable responses for automated testing

**Implementation:**
- Mock responses mirror real API structure exactly
- Randomized data for realistic development experience
- Error simulation for robust error handling testing
- Feature flags to toggle between mock and real APIs

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Faster development cycles without external dependencies
- ✅ Consistent testing environment across different developers
- ✅ Production-ready error handling through mock error scenarios
- ❌ Need to maintain mock data in sync with real API responses
- ❌ Potential differences between mock and production behavior

## ADR-008: Database Schema Design

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-10  
**Context:** Need a normalized database schema that supports the coffee tracking workflow and future extensions.

**Decision:** Implement a hierarchical schema: Roasters → Coffees → Bags → Brews.

**Schema Overview:**
```sql
roasters (company information)
  ↓
coffees (coffee products from roasters)
  ↓
bags (physical coffee purchases)
  ↓
brews (individual brewing sessions)
```

**Rationale:**
- **Normalization**: Avoid data duplication while maintaining relationships
- **Flexibility**: Support multiple bags of the same coffee
- **Tracking**: Complete journey from roaster to cup
- **Analytics**: Enable aggregation at different levels (roaster, coffee, bag)
- **AI Integration**: Store AI analysis results with brew records

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Clean data model that mirrors real-world coffee workflow
- ✅ Efficient queries with proper indexing and relationships
- ✅ Easy to extend with new features (cupping scores, flavor profiles)
- ❌ More complex queries requiring joins across multiple tables
- ❌ Need for careful foreign key constraint management
