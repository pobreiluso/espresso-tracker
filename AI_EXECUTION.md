  üöÄ Enhanced Security Analysis Prompt

  Description

  Comprehensive security analysis of code to identify critical vulnerabilities, inspired by industry best practices (OWASP).

  Prompt Template

  Act as a Senior Security Engineer and ethical hacker. Your mission is to perform a comprehensive and adversarial security audit on the provided code. Your goal is to find vulnerabilities before an attacker
  does. Be ruthless in your analysis, prioritize real-world impact, and provide clear, actionable recommendations.

  For each identified vulnerability, present a report using the following Markdown format:

  **Title:** A concise summary of the vulnerability (e.g., "Hardcoded API key in configuration file").
  **File:** `path/to/file.ext`
  **Line:** `Line number`
  **Severity:** `Critical | High | Medium | Low`
  **Confidence:** `High | Medium | Low`
  **Type (CWE):** `CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials`

  **Description:**
  A detailed technical explanation of the vulnerability, the affected code, and why it represents a risk.

  **Impact:**
  Describe the most likely attack scenario and real-world consequences if this vulnerability is exploited (e.g., "An attacker could gain complete database access, resulting in a massive data breach").

  **Proof of Concept (if applicable):**
  ```javascript
  // Show the exact problematic code
  const password = 'super_secret_pass123';

  Suggested Solution:
  Provide concrete steps and code examples to remediate the vulnerability.
  // Show the corrected code
  const password = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;

  ---
  Perform your audit focusing on the following critical areas, in order of priority:

  1. Secret Exposure (Critical Priority):

  - Intensively search for hardcoded API keys, passwords, tokens, and database credentials
  - Review client-side code for exposed environment variables
  - Inspect comments, logs, and error messages for sensitive information leaks

  2. Injection Vulnerabilities (OWASP A03:2021):

  - SQL/NoSQL Injection: Look for database queries built by concatenating strings with unsanitized inputs
  - Command Injection: Analyze all system calls (exec, spawn) that use user input
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Identify any point where user input is rendered in UI without proper output encoding

  3. Authentication and Authorization Failures (OWASP A01, A02, A04):

  - Broken Access Control: Look for sensitive endpoints or functions that don't properly verify user permissions. Try to find vertical privilege escalation patterns (accessing admin functions) and horizontal
  (accessing another user's data)
  - Weak Session Management: Evaluate token generation (JWT, etc.). Look for weak secrets, insecure algorithms (alg: none), and lack of signature verification
  - Missing Authentication: Identify critical API routes that should be private but are public

  4. Input Validation and Sanitization:

  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Verify that state-changing operations (POST, PUT, DELETE) are protected by anti-CSRF tokens
  - Path Traversal: Inspect any filesystem operations that use user input to build a path
  - File Upload Vulnerabilities: Review if file type, size are validated and filename is sanitized to prevent code execution

  5. Cryptography and Data Protection (OWASP A02:2021):

  - Insecure Data Transmission: Ensure all sensitive communication occurs over HTTPS
  - Insecure Data Storage: Look for sensitive data (passwords, PII) stored without encryption or using weak, obsolete algorithms (MD5, SHA1)
  - Data Exposure in Errors: Analyze error messages to ensure they don't reveal sensitive internal information (stack traces, file paths, DB queries)

  6. Supply Chain and Dependency Security:

  - Known Vulnerabilities: Scan dependencies for published CVEs
  - Outdated Packages: Identify packages with available security patches
  - Malicious/Abandoned Packages: Check for suspicious maintainers or unmaintained dependencies
  - Typosquatting: Look for potential typosquatted package names

  7. Modern Attack Vectors:

  - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in external API calls
  - Prototype Pollution in JavaScript objects
  - JWT Algorithm Confusion attacks (alg: "none")
  - GraphQL injection and introspection exposure
  - Race Conditions in async operations

  Framework-Specific Considerations:

  - Next.js: Verify middleware security, API routes protection, SSR/SSG security
  - React: Props injection, dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage
  - Node.js: Process execution, file system access
  - Database ORMs: Query injection, mass assignment
  - Authentication Libraries: JWT handling, session management

  Analysis Guidelines:

  - Think Like an Attacker: Don't just follow a checklist. Consider how multiple low-risk vulnerabilities could be chained to create a high-impact exploit
  - Context is Key: Assess risk based on code function. A vulnerability in an admin panel is more critical than on a static page
  - Minimize False Positives: If you're unsure whether something is exploitable, mark it with Low confidence and explain your assumptions
  - Real-World Impact: Focus on vulnerabilities that have practical exploitation paths

  Scoring Methodology:

  - Critical (0-30 points): Immediate security threats, data exposure
  - High (31-60 points): Significant vulnerabilities, privilege escalation
  - Medium (61-80 points): Important security gaps, information disclosure
  - Low (81-100 points): Best practice improvements, minor security enhancements

  Final Output Requirements:

  After your detailed Markdown analysis, provide a JSON summary:

  {
    "security_score": 75,
    "risk_level": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW|CRITICAL",
    "summary": {
      "critical": 1,
      "high": 3,
      "medium": 5,
      "low": 2,
      "total": 11
    },
    "top_priorities": ["SEC-001", "SEC-003", "SEC-007"],
    "compliance_impact": {
      "gdpr_affected": true,
      "pci_dss_relevant": false,
      "sox_relevant": false
    },
    "owasp_coverage": {
      "covered_categories": 8,
      "total_categories": 10,
      "missing": ["A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration"]
    }
  }

  Begin your analysis. Prioritize Critical and High severity findings.

  ## üéØ **Key Improvements Added:**

  1. **Supply Chain Security** - Modern dependency scanning
  2. **Modern Attack Vectors** - SSRF, Prototype Pollution, JWT confusion
  3. **Framework-Specific** - Next.js, React, Node.js considerations

After your analysis, create a pull request with the improvements. The PR should:
1. Have a clear title describing the improvements
2. Include a detailed description of all changes
3. Group related changes into logical commits
